    "description": "Catalogued medical knowledge doubles every 73 days. At DocMatter, we enable physicians to harness the power of these big data sets to deliver the best possible patient outcomes.\n\nDocMatter is an AI-driven digital health company that has developed an online, peer-to-peer collaboration platform that streamlines knowledge access across a global network of highly-engaged healthcare professionals. Every physician has a unique combination of experiences, expertise and interests and DocMatter provides them with a time-saving platform to discover, share and learn.\n\nThe problems we address are profound:\n\n- Medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US (Johns Hopkins)\n- Only 55% of patient case treatment algorithms follow recommended care standards (NEJM)\n- Once new clinical data proving superior patient outcomes for a medical product is released, it takes ~17 years for standards of care to change (World Bank)\n- Tens of billions of dollars are spent every year on SG&A by the healthcare industry getting new and innovative medical products in front of doctors (E&Y)\n- The US spends more than $10,000 per individual or 18% of GDP on healthcare, with estimates nearing $1 trillion dollars in total waste (JAMA)\n\nDocMatter provides physicians with actionable insights that every day lead to life-changing outcomes for patients around the world. We are scaling fast, come join us!",
